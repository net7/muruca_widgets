== Iip Flash viewer

The IIP viewer contains just two helpers: Use the #iip_include_tags in your 
HTML <head> section to load all the necessary javascript and the use the
#iip_flash_viewer helper to insert the viewer for an IIP data record.

These helper will only work with the Talia core framework installed.
