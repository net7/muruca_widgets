== Ipod-style dropdown menu

This creates an ipod-style hierarchical dropdown menu using the jquery ui framework. To use it,
use the #fg_menu_includes helper in your HTML <head> AND include the jquery-1.3.2.min.js javascript.

Note: This installs the needed jquery library, if you have another supported version you may
delete jquery-1.3.1.min.js from your 'public/javascripts/' directory.
