== This plugin enables support for colorbox, a jquery-based lightbox clone.

To use the basic functionality, just include the jquery javascript library
and render the 'shared/colorbox' partial in your 
HTML <head>. You can then use the css classes 'cbox_image' and 'cbox_inline' to open
single elements in the colorbox. 

For more advanced functionality, you may edit the colorbox partial template file
