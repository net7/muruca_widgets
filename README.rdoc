= Muruca Widgets

Some widgets that can be used with Talia and other Muruca
components. See the help for the Rails generators for more.

== Installation

Just go 'gem install muruca_widgets'. Then go into your rails
application and say 'script/generate', which will show you 
the generators that are installed through this plugin. Use
the generator for the widget you need - it will give you some
further instructions once it ran through.
